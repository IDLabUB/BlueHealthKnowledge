    "This project starts with curated collections of terms, including blue-health factors and related associations, such as psychological, social, environmental, and policy aspects. Automated literature collection then gathers information from papers using those terms, utilizing [LISC](https://lisc-tools.github.io/).\n",

    "- `Words` analyses: analyzes text data from articles that discuss blue-health factors and wellbeing outcomes\n",

    "- `Count` analyses: searches for co-occurrences of terms, between blue-health factors and associated terms\n",
